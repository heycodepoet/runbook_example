# On Call Runbook Examples

A set of quick guides for what to do when something happens.

## Individual services / components

* [Service X](services/template.md)

## What to do when

* [This happens](troubleshooting/template.md)

## How do I

* [Work out why X is not working](howto/template.md)

## General guidelines in an emergency

* [Use this template](template.md)

## Adding runbooks rules

* Make it quick - add links for checks
* Don't make me think - write clear guidelines, write expectations
* Recommended structure:
    * Symptoms - how can I quickly tell that this is what is going on
    * Pre-checks - how can I be 100% sure
    * Resolution - what do I have to do to fix it
    * Post-checks - how can I be 100% sure that it is solved
    * Rollback - optional, how can I undo my fix

Remember this is meant to be a troubleshooting guide. For general info, use the project's wiki or its README file.

# But always remember!
